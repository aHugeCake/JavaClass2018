	A Java collection framework provides an architecture to store and manipulate a group of objects. A Java collection framework includes the following:
	
	    Interfaces
	    Classes
	    Algorithm


		Interfaces: Interface in Java refers to the abstract data types. They allow Java collections to be manipulated independently from the details of their representation. Also, they form a hierarchy in object-oriented programming languages.
		
		Classes: Classes in Java are the implementation of the collection interface. It basically refers to the data structures that are used again and again.
		
		Algorithm: Algorithm refers to the methods which are used to perform operations such as searching and sorting, on objects that implement collection interfaces. Algorithms are polymorphic in nature as the same method can be used to take many forms or you can say perform different implementations of the Java collection interface.
		
	The Java collection framework provides the developers to access prepackaged data structures as well as algorithms to manipulate data. Next, let us move to the Java collections framework hierarchy and see where these interfaces and classes resides.
