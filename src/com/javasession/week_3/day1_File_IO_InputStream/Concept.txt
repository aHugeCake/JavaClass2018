	/*
	 * Java I/O
	 * 
	 * uses JRE to run to code
	 * it's part of Java-FX framework
	 * 
	 * Input: for read and copy
	 * Output: for write and create
	 * 
	 * 
	 * Stream
	 * Stream are unidirectional
	 * It's means any given stream is either input(Read) or Write to it stream (Can only do one thing only)
	 * 
	 * There are two stream types:
	 * 	- Byte Stream: it's provide binary version of data input output  (audio, image)
	 * 	- Test Stream: it's provide test version of data input output  (documents)
	 * 
	 * Byte: 
	 * 1. InputStream   
	 * 	- ByteArrayInputStream
	 * 	- PipedInputStream
	 * 	- FileInputStream
	 * 
	 * 2. OutputStream	 
	 * 	- ByteArrayOutputStream
	 * 	- PipedOutputStream
	 * 	- FileOutputStream
	 * 
	 * Text:
	 * 1. Reader
	 * 2. Writer
	 * 
	 * 1. Reader
	 * 	- CharArrayReader
	 * 	- StringReader
	 * 	- PipedReader
	 * 	- InputStreamReader -- FileReader
	 * 
	 * 2. Writer
	 * 	- CharArrayWriter
	 * 	- StringWriter
	 * 	- PipedWriter
	 * 	- OutputStreamWriter -- FileWriter
