	//Assignment: Write a code showing the difference between compile time and run time
	//* Note: static binding and dynamic binding (static --> compile time, dynamic --> run time)
	
	/*
	 * Compile Time:
	 * 	Compile
	 * 	Convert text to bytecode
	 * 
	 * Run Time:
	 * 	Interpret and Execute
	 * 	JVM is started and interprets the bytecode
	 * 
	 * 
	 * Static Polymorphism -->	compile time polymorphism	--> overloading
	 * 						|--> Which method would be called is determined by the parameter list at the compile time
	 * Dynamic Polymorphism -->	runtime polymorphism		-->	overriding
	 * 						|--> The type of the object determines which method is to be executed at run-time
	 * Compiler doesn't know the type of an object, but only its base type.
	 * 
	 * 
	 * Binding: when the method is called
	 *
